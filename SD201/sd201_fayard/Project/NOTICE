  TO EXECUTE THE CODE CORECTLY



Question 1

You have a text file that enable you to test the function BuldingDecisionTree.

You can do >>>data=openfile('./test.txt')
           >>>BuldingDecisionTree(data,minNum)

The function will print you the tree as requested, and will return the dictionnary that will be useful for question 2 and 3.





Question 2 


To have your dictionnary, you can type :  >>>dico=BuldingDecisionTree(data)
				
Then you obtain the generalization error with : >>>Generalization_error(data,dico,alpha)






Question 3       >>>Pruned_tree(dico,alpha,data)
